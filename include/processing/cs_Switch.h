/* Power Switch
 * 
 * The Switch class governs the two (separate) pathways that enable power to the load (switch ON) 
 * or disable power to the load (switch OFF)
 * The two pathways are:
 * * the Relay (for high current loads but slow switching times)
 * * the IGBTs (for low current loads but fast switching times)
 * Switching the IGBT pathway is done through Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
 * 
 * #define variables used in this class
 *   - CONFIG_PWM_PERIOD          		Time between consecutive switch ON actions during PWM dim cycle
 * 	 - CONFIG_RELAY_HIGH_DURATION		Duration of time in which power is supplied to the relay in order to switch it
 * 
 * There are several things that influence the switch behavior (in order of importance):
 *   - IGBT overload (soft fuse).
 *   - Relay overload (soft fuse).
 *   - PWM powered (hardware restriction).
 *   - Dimming allowed (config).
 *   - Switch lock (config).
 *
